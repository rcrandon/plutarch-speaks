EPISODE ZERO: Of the Arthashastra, and the Origins of Economic Science in the Court of Chandragupta Maurya

[OPENING - DRAMATIC HOOK]

Imagine a world where the science of wealth has not yet been written down.

Where kings rule by instinct and tradition, where merchants keep their secrets close, where the art of governance passes from father to son in whispered councils. Imagine a world waiting for someone to look at the chaos of human commerce... and find the patterns hidden within.

This is the story of how that changed. This is the story of the first economist.

[INTRODUCING THE PODCAST]

Welcome. I am Plutarch. And this... is Plutarch Speaks.

In the episodes that follow, I will be your guide through the great stories of commerce, of economics, of the rise and fall of business empires. We will travel from ancient trading posts to modern boardrooms. We will meet emperors and merchants, innovators and fraudsters, visionaries who built and fools who destroyed.

But every journey must have a beginning. And ours begins here... in a painting.

[DESCRIBING THE PAINTING]

Look at it.

A hall of polished stone, its pillars carved with lions and elephants in the Mauryan style. Through an archway, you can see war elephants with golden howdahs, and beyond them, the haze of a great city on the banks of a river.

In the center of the painting stands an old man. He is gaunt, almost skeletal. His chest is bare save for a sacred thread. His hair is matted, pulled back in the topknot of an ascetic. He wears only a simple white dhoti, the garment of one who has renounced worldly things.

But there is nothing humble about his posture. He extends a bundle of palm-leaf manuscripts toward a figure on a throne... and his eyes burn with the fire of absolute certainty.

The man on the throne is young. Perhaps twenty-five. He sits upon the simhasana, the lion throne, its golden armrests shaped like the king of beasts. He wears the mukuta crown with peacock plumes, and around his neck hang ropes of pearls and gold. His dark eyes regard the manuscript with an expression that might be reverence... or might be calculation.

Around them stand the ministers and nobles of the court. Men in white robes with gold borders, some wearing the ushnisha turban of high officials. Their faces show a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. They sense that something momentous is happening.

At their feet, scattered like offerings before an altar: scales of brass, coins of punched silver, scrolls and account books. The instruments of commerce. The tools of empire.

[THE STORY]

The old man is Chanakya. Some call him Kautilya, others Vishnugupta. He is a Brahmin scholar, a priest of the highest caste, who was driven from the court of the Nanda kings after suffering some grave insult. History does not record exactly what they did to him. But it records what he did in return.

He found a boy. A commoner, some say, though others claim royal blood. He trained this boy in warfare, in statecraft, in the arts of kingship. And then... he unleashed him.

In a campaign that lasted less than two years, Chandragupta Maurya swept away the Nanda dynasty, conquered their capital, and established an empire that would stretch from Bengal to Afghanistan. He did what Alexander the Great could not: he unified the subcontinent under a single crown.

And the manuscript that Chanakya now presents to his creation? It is the Arthashastra. The Science of Wealth. The Science of Statecraft.

[THE SIGNIFICANCE]

What is contained in these palm leaves would not be matched in the Western world for nearly two thousand years.

Taxation policy: Chanakya advises that a king should tax his people as a bee gathers honey - taking just enough to sustain the hive, never so much as to kill the flower.

Trade regulation: Standards for weights and measures. Quality control for goods. Penalties for fraud.

Treasury management: How to mint coins, prevent counterfeiting, invest surplus revenue.

Espionage: Networks of spies in every village, every guild, every foreign court.

And more: Urban planning. Sanitation. Famine relief. The management of mines, forests, and elephant herds.

When Western scholars finally translated the Arthashastra in the early twentieth century - the manuscript had been lost for over a thousand years - they were stunned. Here was proof that ancient India had developed economic and administrative science to a degree that Europe would not achieve until the modern era.

[CLOSING - WHAT THE PODCAST WILL BE]

This is the kind of story we will tell.

Not the stories you learned in school. Not the familiar tales of kings and battles. But the deeper stories. The stories of how wealth is created and destroyed. Of how trade routes rise and fall. Of how a single innovation can transform an empire... and how a single mistake can doom one.

We will visit the counting houses of medieval Florence and the trading posts of ancient Carthage. We will examine corporate scandals and economic miracles. We will ask: what can the past teach us about prosperity? About collapse? About the eternal human struggle to build something that lasts?

These are the stories that shaped our world. And they are waiting to be told.

I am Plutarch. Thank you for joining me.
