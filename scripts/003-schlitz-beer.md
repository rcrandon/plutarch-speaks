Milwaukee, 1970.

In a gleaming corporate boardroom overlooking Lake Michigan, the executives of the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company survey an empire. They are the kings of American beer. For three consecutive years, Schlitz has outsold every other brewery in the nation. Fifty million barrels a year flow from their facilities. The slogan on every tongue is theirs: "The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous."

And yet, within a decade, this colossus will lie in ruins — its market share collapsed, its reputation destroyed, its very name a byword for corporate self-destruction. The tale of how this happened contains lessons that every student of business would do well to heed.

The trouble began, as it so often does, with success itself. In the early 1970s, Schlitz's leadership grew impatient. The beer business, you see, is one of thin margins and slow processes. Brewing takes time. Quality ingredients cost money. But the executives wanted faster growth, higher profits, and they believed they had found a shortcut.

First came "Accelerated Batch Fermentation." Traditional lager requires weeks of careful aging. Schlitz cut this to days. The accountants rejoiced. The brewmasters, who knew that patience is the soul of good beer, were overruled.

Then came the ingredients. Hop pellets replaced fresh hops. High-fructose corn syrup replaced more expensive malted barley. A silica gel treatment was introduced to reduce "chill haze" — that cloudiness that appears when beer gets cold. Each change was individually defensible. Each saved money. And each stripped away something of what had made Schlitz... Schlitz.

The disaster announced itself gradually, then all at once. The silica gel interacted with the new protein-reduced formula in ways no one had anticipated. A strange, mucus-like substance began forming in bottles as they sat on store shelves. Customers poured out what they expected to be golden lager and received instead something that resembled pond water laced with snot.

Schlitz recalled ten million bottles. Then ten million more. The company's response — deny, minimize, blame the consumer — only compounded the catastrophe. When a brand has promised quality for a century, when fathers have passed down their loyalty to sons, the betrayal of that trust is not easily forgiven.

By 1981, what had been America's best-selling beer could not give itself away. Market share had fallen from eighteen percent to less than five. The Stroh Brewing Company acquired the corpse for a pittance, and by the end of the century, even that acquirer had failed, dragged down in part by the dead weight of Schlitz's ruined reputation.

What are the lessons here, my Dominus?

First: your brand is a promise. Every product that bears your name is a renewal of that promise. When you break it for cost savings, you do not save money — you spend reputation, which is far more expensive to rebuild.

Second: beware the seduction of optimization without wisdom. Each individual cost cut at Schlitz was logical in isolation. It was only in aggregate that they became fatal. The spreadsheet cannot taste the beer.

Third: the people closest to the product — the brewmasters, the craftsmen, the workers — often see what executives cannot. When they warn you that you are destroying something irreplaceable, you would do well to listen.

And finally: in an age of efficiency and analytics, remember that some things cannot be measured but can certainly be lost. The intangible qualities that make customers love a product — the care, the consistency, the sense that someone gives a damn — these are worth more than all the savings your cost-cutting can produce.

The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous became the beer that made Milwaukee weep. Let us ensure that our own enterprises never earn such an epitaph.
