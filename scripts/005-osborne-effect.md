## Script

Silicon Valley, nineteen eighty-one.

Adam Osborne stands at the summit of personal computing. His Osborne One — a portable computer the size of a sewing machine, priced at seventeen hundred ninety-five dollars — has conquered America. Where competitors charge four thousand, Osborne bundles software worth fifteen hundred dollars free. Dealers cannot keep inventory. Revenue soars past one hundred million dollars. Osborne Computer Corporation files for a public offering.

The business press crowns Osborne a prophet. He is, by all appearances, unstoppable.

Then, in the spring of nineteen eighty-three, Osborne commits a sin so instructive that business schools would name it after him for the next four decades.

At a press conference, flush with confidence, Osborne announces his next-generation machines: the Executive and the Vixen. They will be faster, lighter, superior in every way. They will arrive in the fall. The Osborne One, he implies, is yesterday's technology.

The effect was immediate and catastrophic.

Customers stopped buying. Dealers cancelled orders. Why purchase an obsolete machine when the future was merely months away? Inventory stacked in warehouses. Cash flow collapsed. The company that had sold ten thousand machines per month suddenly sold almost none.

Osborne scrambled to retract, to reassure, but the damage was irrevocable. In September nineteen eighty-three — the very month his revolutionary new products were to ship — Osborne Computer Corporation filed for bankruptcy.

From one hundred million dollars to zero in eighteen months.

The postmortem reveals a deeper truth than mere tactical error. Osborne had confused *building enthusiasm* with *destroying demand*. He spoke as an engineer marveling at progress, not as a merchant protecting his inventory. He imagined customers would share his excitement for the future while continuing to purchase the present.

They did not. They simply waited. And in their waiting, they killed him.

This pattern — announcing future products that cannibalize current sales — became known as the Osborne Effect. Apple has danced with it. Samsung has feared it. Every technology company that pre-announces must weigh the marketing benefit against the revenue destruction.

What strategic lessons emerge from this wreckage?

First: *timing is inventory*. The moment between announcement and delivery is not neutral space — it is a period when customers actively choose not to buy. Every day of that gap costs money.

Second: *engineers and merchants think differently*. The engineer celebrates obsolescence as progress. The merchant knows that obsolescence announced is revenue foregone.

Third: *confidence kills*. Osborne was not lying or scheming. He was simply certain — certain his company could survive any disruption, certain his customers would remain loyal, certain the future would arrive on schedule. That certainty was the poison.

The Osborne Effect endures as terminology precisely because it recurs. Sega announced the Saturn and destroyed the Genesis. Cisco pre-announced and watched sales collapse. The temptation to showcase the future never dies, and neither does the cost.

Adam Osborne lost his company. But he gave us something valuable: his name, forever attached to a mistake others need not repeat.

Let his failure be your fortune, my Dominus. Announce nothing until you can deliver everything.
