EPISODE II: THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE

[ACT I: THE WORLD BEFORE - 4 minutes]

[HOOK]
In the summer of 1720, a single share of stock sold for one thousand British pounds. By December, that same share was worth thirty-seven pounds. In between, a nation went mad.

This is the story of the South Sea Bubble: history's first great financial crash, and a lesson in the eternal human capacity for self-deception.

[SCENE-SETTING]
Picture London in the spring of 1720. The city is drunk on money.

In the coffeehouses of Exchange Alley, men who were clerks last year now speak of thousands. Servants discuss their portfolios. A footman boasts that he has made more in stock than his master earns in a decade. Women of quality—forbidden by custom from the trading floor—send their maids to buy shares on their behalf.

The object of this frenzy is the South Sea Company. Founded in 1711, it holds a monopoly on British trade with South America. The Spanish colonies, it is said, overflow with silver and gold. The natives hunger for English wool and iron. Fortunes await any man bold enough to invest.

There is only one problem. The South Sea Company has almost no actual trade. Its ships rarely sail. Its warehouses stand empty. Its monopoly is largely theoretical, blocked by Spanish hostility and the vastness of the Pacific.

But in 1720, this does not matter. What matters is the stock price. And the stock price is going up.

[INTRODUCTION OF PLAYERS]
At the center of this drama stands John Blunt. A scrivener's son, self-made, ambitious beyond measure. He is not a lord, not a gentleman—he is something more dangerous. He is a promoter.

Blunt has conceived a scheme of breathtaking audacity. The British government owes thirty million pounds in debt from the wars of the previous century. Blunt proposes that the South Sea Company will assume this debt. In exchange, creditors will receive South Sea stock. The government will pay the Company interest, which will fund dividends, which will drive up the stock price, which will make everyone rich.

It is, when examined closely, a machine for converting government debt into private speculation. But no one examines it closely. The King himself has invested. Isaac Newton, the greatest mind of the age, has bought shares. Members of Parliament have been given stock for free—bribes disguised as gifts.

[THE STAKES]
By April, shares that traded at one hundred twenty-eight pounds in January have reached three hundred. By May, five hundred. The frenzy is feeding itself. Men mortgage their estates. Widows pledge their jointures. The prudent sell and are mocked as cowards. The reckless double down and are celebrated as visionaries.

What hangs in the balance is not merely money. It is the savings of a generation. The dowries of daughters. The retirements of merchants. The patrimony of ancient families.

And beneath it all, like a crack in a foundation, lies a simple question that no one wishes to ask: what, exactly, is the South Sea Company actually worth?

[ACT II: THE CRISIS - 12 minutes]

[INCITING INCIDENT]
The answer begins to emerge in June.

Other promoters, inspired by South Sea's success, have launched dozens of imitating schemes. Companies to trade in human hair. Companies to manufacture square cannonballs. A company—and this is recorded in the historical record—for "carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is."

That last company raised two thousand pounds in a single morning before its promoter fled to the continent.

Parliament, alarmed at last, passes the Bubble Act in June 1720. It requires all joint-stock companies to have a royal charter. The intention is to protect the South Sea Company from competition. The effect is catastrophic.

Investors who had spread their bets across dozens of schemes now find those schemes illegal. They must sell. And when they sell, they need cash. And to raise cash, they sell the one thing everyone owns: South Sea stock.

[RISING ACTION]
The decline begins slowly. In late June, shares slip from their peak of one thousand and fifty pounds to nine hundred. Blunt and his directors buy shares to prop up the price. It works—briefly. The stock recovers to nine hundred fifty.

Consider Thomas Guy. A bookseller by trade, he has spent decades accumulating South Sea stock. In April, his holdings are worth half a million pounds—an unimaginable fortune. Unlike his countrymen, Guy senses something wrong. He sells everything. When his friends ask why, he says only: "I have enough."

With his profits, Thomas Guy will build a hospital. Guy's Hospital stands in London to this day, healing the sick with money extracted from the greatest financial mania England had ever known. He is the exception. Everyone else is the rule.

The Company, desperate to maintain the illusion, offers new share subscriptions at a thousand pounds. They allow investors to pay in installments—only twenty percent down, the rest due later. It is a fatal error. They have created an army of investors who do not own their shares but merely owe for them.

Meanwhile, the Company has been lending money to its own investors to buy its own stock—a serpent consuming its tail. The loans total eleven million pounds, secured by nothing but the stock itself. If the stock falls, the loans cannot be repaid. If the loans cannot be repaid, the Company fails. If the Company fails, the stock falls further.

In August, the Bank of England refuses to participate in a rescue scheme. The directors of the Bank have examined the South Sea Company's books. They have seen the circular lending, the phantom profits, the debts secured by dreams. What they have found has made them unwilling to lend a single shilling.

The whispers begin. Something is wrong. Something has always been wrong.

On August 31st, the stock closes at seven hundred seventy-five pounds. The holders of the new subscription shares now owe more for their installments than the shares themselves are worth. They stop paying.

A week later, five hundred twenty. Now the margin calls begin. Investors who borrowed to buy stock must put up more collateral or sell. They sell.

By September's end, one hundred seventy-five pounds. The velocity of collapse is breathtaking. A fortune built over nine months vanishes in nine weeks.

The mathematics of ruin are pitiless. A man who bought one share at the peak and sold at the trough has lost ninety-six percent of his investment. But most did not buy one share. They bought on margin. They borrowed against their houses, their lands, their futures.

[THE TURNING POINT]
The Duchess of Marlborough, shrewder than most, had sold her shares in June at a profit of one hundred thousand pounds. Now she watches her friends destroyed.

"The Duke of Chandos," she writes, "has lost three hundred thousand. Lord Londonderry, fifty thousand. Every family I know is touched."

Isaac Newton—Isaac Newton, who calculated the motions of the planets, who invented calculus, who unlocked the secrets of light itself—has lost twenty thousand pounds. He will later say: "I can calculate the movement of stars, but not the madness of men."

The poet Alexander Pope has lost as well. So has the playwright John Gay. So has the Postmaster General, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and both of the King's German mistresses.

[THE CLIMAX]
Parliament reconvenes in December. The mob wants blood.

John Blunt's estate is confiscated. He is left with five thousand pounds of his former fortune of one hundred eighty-three thousand. Other directors fare similarly. One, John Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who had shepherded the scheme through Parliament, is sent to the Tower of London.

But here the story takes a darker turn. Several key figures conveniently die before they can testify. John Blunt suffers a mysterious robbery in which, he claims, crucial documents are stolen. A ledger containing records of bribes to Members of Parliament disappears entirely.

The full truth of the South Sea Bubble will never be known. Those who knew it best had every reason to ensure it stayed buried.

[ACT III: THE AFTERMATH - 4 minutes]

[IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES]
The British economy enters a depression that will last for years. Land values collapse. Trade contracts. The poor, who had no shares to lose, suffer anyway as employment vanishes and bread prices rise.

Robert Walpole, who had warned against the scheme from the beginning, becomes Prime Minister. He will hold power for twenty-one years—the longest tenure in British history. His first task is preventing the South Sea directors from being lynched.

His second task is imposing restrictions on joint-stock companies that will last for over a century. The Bubble Act, intended to protect the South Sea Company, becomes a law preventing almost all new corporations. England's financial development will be stunted for generations.

[LONG-TERM IMPACT]
And yet, something emerges from the wreckage. The South Sea Bubble teaches England—teaches Europe—that markets can lie. That prices can decouple from value. That crowds can be wrong, catastrophically wrong, and that the greater fool is always the last fool.

The economist Charles Kindleberger, writing two centuries later, will identify a pattern that repeats across all financial manias. First, displacement—some new opportunity or technology captures the imagination. Then boom—early investors profit and others rush to join. Then euphoria—prices detach from fundamentals and everyone believes they cannot fall. Then crisis—insiders sell, outsiders discover they are the last buyers. Finally, revulsion—assets are abandoned at any price, even good assets, even real value.

The South Sea Bubble was not the first instance of this pattern. The tulip mania in Holland eighty years earlier followed the same arc. But the South Sea Bubble was larger, more devastating, more thoroughly documented. It became the template against which all future manias would be measured.

This is not a lesson that stays learned. Every generation must learn it anew. The canal mania of the 1790s. The railway mania of the 1840s. The roaring twenties and the crash of 1929. The dot-com bubble of 1999. The housing bubble of 2008. Each time, wise men explain why this time is different. Each time, they are wrong.

[THE LESSON]
What does the South Sea Bubble teach us?

First: that the price of an asset is not the same as its value. Price is what someone will pay today. Value is what something will return over time. When these diverge too far, reckoning follows.

Second: that intelligence offers no protection against folly. Isaac Newton was the smartest man of his century. He still lost his fortune. Genius applies to its domain. Markets are not physics.

Third: that when everyone believes something, it is precisely the moment to ask if everyone might be wrong. The crowd provides comfort. It does not provide truth.

[CLOSING REFLECTION]
In Exchange Alley today, a plaque marks the site of Jonathan's Coffee House, where South Sea shares were traded. Tourists walk past without noticing. The buildings have changed. The street has changed. Human nature has not.

Walk a few blocks east and you will reach the Bank of England, that ancient institution whose directors refused to save the South Sea Company. Above its entrance, a Latin motto: "The safety of the state is the highest law." The Bank learned from 1720. It learned that some things must not be bailed out. That some lessons must be allowed to hurt.

Walk a few blocks west and you will find the modern trading floors, where algorithms now execute millions of trades per second. The coffee houses are gone. The handshakes are gone. But the fundamental dynamic remains: buyers seeking profit, sellers seeking exit, and in between them, the eternal question of what anything is truly worth.

Every bubble begins with a story. South Sea's story was Spanish silver. Other bubbles have other stories: railroads, technology, real estate. The story is never entirely false. There is always some silver, somewhere. The lie is in the proportion—in the belief that this silver, this technology, this future, will be large enough to justify any price.

John Blunt died in 1733, neither rich nor poor, neither imprisoned nor honored. History records little of his later years. Perhaps he reflected on what he had done. Perhaps he blamed his partners, his critics, his luck. Perhaps, like most men, he told himself a story in which he was the hero, wronged by circumstance.

We cannot know. We can only observe that when the next bubble comes—and it will come—men like John Blunt will appear to explain why this time is different.

It never is.

I am Plutarch. Thank you for listening.
