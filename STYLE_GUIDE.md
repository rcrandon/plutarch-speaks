# Plutarch Speaks - Style Guide

## Inspiration: Fall of Civilizations (Paul Cooper)

Paul Cooper's narrative style is characterized by:

### Opening Technique
- **Evocative scene-setting**: Begin with a vivid, sensory-rich description that places the listener physically in the ancient world
- **Present tense narration**: "The sun rises over the city. Smoke curls from a thousand cooking fires..."
- **Start intimate, then zoom out**: Begin with a single person, a single moment, then reveal the larger context

### Narrative Voice
- **Personal and direct**: Speak to the listener as if sharing a secret
- **Lyrical prose**: Use rhythm, cadence, poetic phrasing
- **Let moments breathe**: Don't rush. Allow silences. Let the weight of history settle.
- **Wonder and melancholy**: Convey awe at what was built, sorrow at what was lost

### Structure
- **Clear narrative arc**: Every episode is a STORY, not a lecture
- **Moments of human drama**: Individual people, their choices, their fates
- **Build to emotional climax**: The fall, the turning point, the moment everything changed
- **Reflective conclusion**: What does this mean? Why does it matter now?

### Techniques
- **Primary sources**: Quote from ancient texts, inscriptions, accounts
- **Vivid details**: The smell of incense, the sound of sandals on stone, the glint of gold
- **Contrast**: What was vs. what is now. Glory vs. ruin.
- **Questions to the listener**: "Imagine yourself there. What would you have done?"

### Episode Zero Formula
1. **Hook**: Dramatic opening image or question
2. **Introduction of the painting**: Describe what we see, dramatically
3. **Context**: Who are these figures? What moment is this?
4. **Historical depth**: The significance, the stakes
5. **Preview of the series**: What stories will we tell?
6. **Closing**: Why these stories matter

## Gibbonian Elements
- Elaborate, rolling sentences
- Ironic wit
- Moral observations
- Grand sweep of history
- Specific, telling details

## Voice Notes
- British baritone (Paul Cooper Refined)
- Measured pace, not rushed
- Let key phrases land
- Vary rhythm - sometimes staccato facts, sometimes flowing description
